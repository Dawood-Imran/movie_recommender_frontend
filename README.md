## MovieMate

It is a web-based Movie Recommender application built with React and Firebase. The front-end provides a user-friendly interface for users to sign up, sign in, and access a movie search page. The application is designed to eventually integrate with a back-end (planned with FastAPI) and the TMDB API to offer content-based and collaborative filtering recommendations
